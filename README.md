📊 Student Performance Analytics Dashboard

This dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of student performance and related academic metrics across multiple departments and countries. Designed using an interactive and visually appealing layout, it helps educational institutions make data-driven decisions for better academic management.

🔍 Overview

The Student Performance Analytics Dashboard is divided into key performance indicators (KPIs), visual charts, and detailed tabular data to track and evaluate various metrics such as total students, courses, pass/fail statistics, department-wise and country-wise performance, financial data, and enrollment trends.

📈 Key Metrics & Visual Components

Top KPIs

Total Students: Displays the total number of students, which stands at 6,000.

Total Courses: Indicates there are 50 distinct courses offered.

Total Passed: Highlights that 6,000 students have passed, representing 90% of the student population.

Total Failed: Shows that 596 students failed, which is 9.6% of the total.

Total Books Returns in Months
This is represented through a treemap chart categorizing book return patterns. Each block corresponds to different labeled clusters (e.g., “Phased cohesive service-desk,” “Reverse-engineered transition”), showing varied usage or return volume trends across time.

Payment Breakdown
A stacked column chart demonstrates the breakdown of payments over months, categorized by payment methods:

Bank Transfer

Online Payment

The left y-axis represents the amount paid, and the right y-axis shows the total number of students. This helps in visualizing the financial behavior of students over time, with data from 2015 to 2016.

Enrollment Date Breakdown
A time series line graph tracks student enrollment trends from 2015 to 2024, highlighting seasonal fluctuations and predicting near-future enrollment using shaded projections. It reveals insights into peak admission months and consistency in student intake.

Department & Country-wise Student Distribution
A detailed matrix table shows the number of students across different departments—Arts, Commerce, Engineering, and Science—for various countries including:

American Samoa

Bosnia and Herzegovina

Djibouti

Germany

This section provides a granular view of academic participation, useful for department and regional performance comparison.
